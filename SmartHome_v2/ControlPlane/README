Key Features:

Device Integration: Use embedded Linux and GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) to interface with various smart devices such as lights, fans, and sensors.

Web Application: Develop a web application using microservices architecture with React, Node.js, and Express.js. The application will allow users to control and monitor connected devices remotely.

OS System Calls: Utilize OS system calls and libraries to manage low-level hardware interactions and I/O operations on the embedded Linux device.

Database Management: Implement a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store user preferences, device configurations, and historical data.

User Authentication and Authorization: Secure the web application with user authentication and authorization to control access to different devices and features.

Real-time Communication: Use WebSockets or similar technology to enable real-time communication between the web application and the embedded system for immediate device status updates.

Docker Containers: Containerize microservices using Docker to ensure easy deployment and scaling.
