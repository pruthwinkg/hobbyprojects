 - Make the Desktop accessible from outside
 - Create an app to get the health of desktop (app running outside) (app can be Android app.. Private app)
 - Can extend this later to add more applications like Home status, Home Temparature etc...
 - Allow an task to be run from outside on Desktop
 - Have to be very Security
 - Build a generic infra for this....



To enable ssh on Linux :

https://www.dynu.com/Resources/Tutorials/DynamicDNS/How-to-access-CentOS-Ubuntu-Linux-Machine-remotely

To allow a guest user on computer :

https://askubuntu.com/questions/16650/create-a-new-ssh-user-on-ubuntu-server

Check the end of file for Custom SSH config --> Edit SSH config file: sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Also on 192.168.1.1 (Home Router ---> Port forwarding rule is added.. Check under "Nat Forwarding"...)

Added a new user "guest" with passwd "guest" for ssh access
https://www.tecmint.com/add-users-in-linux/


Now, ONLY guest/guest has ssh access and no root permission for him


TODO:

Restrict permissions for guest user from linux. Allow him to access only certain files and have certain permission
Can also create many guests and add them in a group. Have very little permission for them
guest/guest can be the psuedo "root" guest from app perspective. But NEVER give the actual root , ssh permission.. Not secure
root should be allowed to operate ONLY physically and locally this computer. NO remote permissions EVER !!!!


Create an infra to have my own messaging (custom) ---> Research about it

See if only ssh is sufficient to be enabled for commands/msgs/data to be exchanged between client and server.
