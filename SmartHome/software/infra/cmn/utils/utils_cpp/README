This folder is used soley for the purpose of using already available data structres in C++ STL,
to be used in the utils library, thereby not re-inventing the wheel. This directory could even be 
extended for other functionalities of the utils library

It is not recommended for the applications or infra modules to call the functions in this library directly. 
Instead they can call the functions defined in utils library and set the library mode to CPP or Mixed. 
A thin wrapper is added in the utils library to make use of the C++ STL library without the callers knowing about it,
so that a unique interface could be used throughout the project for managing the data strucutres

The calling applications or modules can use the utils internal implemenatation or C++ STL during the 
utils library init by setting the utils library mode appropriately.
