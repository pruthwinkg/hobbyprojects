Messenger API - MAPI

This library defines a set of simple APIs for inter and intra process communication.
The main objective of this library is to simply the communication between processes without the applications
worrying about forming sockets, using uds/udp for local/external communication etc.

The other modules such as Communication Manager, Interface Manager could use the MAPI as the base Communication
mechanism before building another Communication layer on top of this.

Notes:
    - This library needs to run in a seperate thread
    - It identifies the apps/infra modules using the UID (static or dynamic) only
    - For internal communication it uses Unix Domain Sockets by default. But it could be changed via API
    - For external communication it uses TCP/UDP.
    - This library can support creation of multiple MAPI IDs per app. In this case create one thread per MAPI ID
    - The library supports two modes - STREAM or DGRAM for both internal and external communication
    - The DGRAM mode is very easy to use by the application, with few APIs to be invoked.
    - The STREAM mode is bit complex with lot of options to configure.
