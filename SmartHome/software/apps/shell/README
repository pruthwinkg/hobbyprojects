Application Name : shell

Functionality:
    The shell application is UI for the whole system. The shell is capable of taking
    various commands from the user, process it and pass it to the appropriate modules
    in the system.

    Shell broadly does the below functions:
    - show commands
    - configure commands
    - debug commands

Notes:
    It is implmented to handle both the infra modules and as well user apps. Also, it
    provides extensions/APIs to integrate to an actual UI. It makes use of Communication
    Manager Service to pass user-commands to various apps.

    The shell application also has a library part which the participating components integrates.
    Since the shell application uses the Communication Manager Service, the applications should
    have the Communication Library Client up and running. The responses from the applications for the
    requests sent by the shell program will be served by the application itself using the shell library
